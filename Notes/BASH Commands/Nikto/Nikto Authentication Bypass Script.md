To perform an authentication bypass scan using Nikto, you can use the `-T` option to specify the tuning level and include the authentication bypass tests. Here's how you can do it:

### Command Breakdown

1. `nikto`: This is the command to run the Nikto tool. Nikto is an open-source web server scanner that performs comprehensive tests to identify potentially dangerous files/programs, outdated versions of servers, server configuration items, and installed web software2.
    
2. `-h http://127.0.0.1`:
    
    - `-h` is the option to specify the target URL for the scan.
        
    - `http://127.0.0.1` indicates that the scan is to be performed on the web application running on the local machine (127.0.0.1 is the loopback IP address, equivalent to `localhost`).
        
3. `-T 9`: The `-T` option specifies the tuning level. The value `9` includes all tests, including authentication bypass tests.
    

### Example Command

bash

```
nikto -h http://127.0.0.1 -T 9
```

### What Does It Do?

When you run this command, Nikto will perform a comprehensive scan of the web application at `http://127.0.0.1`, including tests for authentication bypass vulnerabilities1. It will check for common authentication bypass techniques and report any findings in the output.

### Example Output

An example output from this scan might look something like this:

To perform an authentication bypass scan using Nikto, you can use the `-Tuning` option to focus on specific types of vulnerabilities, including authentication bypass. Here's how you can do it:

### Command Breakdown

4. `nikto`: This is the command to run the Nikto tool. Nikto is an open-source web server scanner that performs comprehensive tests to identify potentially dangerous files/programs, outdated versions of servers, server configuration items, and installed web software.
    
5. `-Tuning a`: The `-Tuning` option allows you to specify the types of tests to include in the scan. The letter `a` stands for **Authentication Bypass**. This tuning option focuses on tests that check for vulnerabilities allowing unauthorized access to resources.
    
6. `-h http://127.0.0.1`: `-h` specifies the target URL for the scan. In this case, it's `http://127.0.0.1`, which is the local machine.
    

### Example Command

bash

```
nikto -Tuning a -h http://127.0.0.1
```

### What Does It Do?

When you run this command, Nikto will perform a scan focused on identifying authentication bypass vulnerabilities on the web application running on your local machine1. It will check for issues such as:

- Misconfigured authentication mechanisms
    
- Default or weak credentials
    
- Bypass methods for protected resources
